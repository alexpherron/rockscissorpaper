This is a project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav)

I was first tasked with practicing JavaScript by recreating a game of Rock, Scissors, Paper. Where the player will play against he computer in a best of 5 match.

Later, I need to practice DOM manipulation by making an interactive and dynamic webpage. I had to go back and alter the original jsonly file, so I decided to include both.
